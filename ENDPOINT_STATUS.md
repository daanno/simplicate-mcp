## üéØ Recommendations for MCP Server

### 1. Focus on Working Endpoints

Your MCP server should prioritize the 15 working endpoints for reliable operation:

**Core Features to Emphasize:**
- ‚úÖ Projects and Project Services
- ‚úÖ CRM (Organizations & Persons)
- ‚úÖ Sales Quotes
- ‚úÖ Hours/Timesheet Tracking
- ‚úÖ HRM (Employees, Leave, Absences, Timetable)
- ‚úÖ Invoices and Payments
- ‚úÖ Services Management
- ‚úÖ Documents

### 2. Add Graceful Fallbacks

For the 400-error endpoints, add try-catch blocks that:
- Return empty arrays instead of throwing errors
- Log warnings for debugging
- Suggest alternative queries to users

### 3. Update Tool Descriptions

Update MCP tool descriptions to clarify which features work reliably vs. which may have limitations.

## üîç For Checking Dwayne's Availability

Based on working endpoints, here's how to check availability:

### Option 1: Use Leave Data (‚úÖ Works!)
```
GET /hrm/leave?limit=50
```
**Shows:** Planned vacations and time off

### Option 2: Use Timetable (‚úÖ Works!)
```
GET /hrm/timetable?limit=50
```
**Shows:** Regular schedule/working hours

### Option 3: Use Absences (‚úÖ Works!)
```
GET /hrm/absence?limit=50
```
**Shows:** Sick days and unplanned absences

### Option 4: Use Hours (‚úÖ Works!)
```
GET /hours/hours?limit=50
```
**Shows:** Actual logged hours (what's already done)

### Combined Approach (Recommended)
```
1. Get employee list to find Dwayne's ID
2. Get leave entries for upcoming weeks
3. Get absences for current period
4. Get timetable for regular schedule
5. Cross-reference hours to see what's logged
```

## üêõ Known Issues

### Issue 1: Tasks Endpoint Requires Project Filter
The `/projects/task` endpoint needs a project_id parameter:
```
GET /projects/task?project_id=xxx
```

### Issue 2: Search Endpoint Not Tested
The `/search` endpoint wasn't tested but is documented in Simplicate API.

## üìù Testing Commands

To re-run this test:
```bash
node test-all-endpoints.js

To test specific endpoint:
```bash
node test-connection.js
```

## ‚úÖ Action Items

- [x] Identify all working endpoints
- [ ] Update MCP server to handle 400 errors gracefully
- [ ] Add endpoint-specific parameter handling
- [ ] Update documentation with working endpoints
- [ ] Test POST/PUT/DELETE operations on working endpoints
- [ ] Investigate if 400-error endpoints work with filters

---

**Conclusion:** Your Simplicate instance has **65% of endpoints working**. The MCP server should focus on these reliable endpoints and add graceful error handling for the others.
