## 🔧 Two Ways to Use

### Option 1: AI Agent (Natural Language) ⭐ Recommended
```
+ Natural language queries
+ Handles complex multi-step tasks
+ Intelligent filtering and analysis
+ Conversational responses
- Uses more tokens
- Slightly slower
```

**Setup:** Add system prompt to AI Agent node

### Option 2: Direct MCP (Exact Tool Calls)
```
+ 100% reliable
